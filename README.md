# Grades Auto Filler

In this project we used our knowledge in python and image

processing algorithms to make an automatic grades auto filler

that can help the professors and TAs to make the process of 

correcting exam papers and gathering grades much faster

and more comfortable


## The project was divided into two separate parts:

### Part 1 (Bubble sheet corrector):

In this part we made a full programm with its GUI that

takes in a bubble sheet as a model answer and the students

bubble sheets and corrects them giving as an output the paper

of each student after circling the student answers in green if

correct and in red otherwise as you can see in the following photo

and an excel sheet containing the details of each student

also a single excel sheet containing the details of all students.
